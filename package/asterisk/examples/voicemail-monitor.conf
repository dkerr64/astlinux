;
; An extension can monitor an incoming caller leave a message on their
; voicemail.  If the callee decides to speak to the caller they can 
; intercept the voicemail by pressing any key on their phone, recording
; will be suspended and the two parties can talk to each other.
;
; In a household environment it may be desirable to intercept the caller
; from another extension.  You can do this by dialing 1 from any other extension
; in the house.  You can also use this dial 1 feature to join another conversation
; already in place in your household even if someone is not leaving a voicemail.
;

[DefaultDialPlan]
; Add this to your default dialplan if you want to support intercept
; from any extension in your household...
; Dial 1 to intercept voicemail being monitored by another extension
; or to connect to another conversation underway (3-way call).
; Note filter on extension, in this case to match against caller coming
; from range of extensions 100 to 109...  This protects against any other
; extension intercepting the conversation.
